## 🧠 Overview  

**Newton 3** is a dedicated physics engine extension for **Adobe After Effects** that transforms static layers into dynamically reacting elements. By applying real-world physical rules, it allows motion to unfold naturally without relying solely on traditional animation methods.

Instead of adjusting endless keyframes, creators can simulate gravity, impacts, and constraints to produce believable movement. This makes Newton 3 especially effective for complex scenes where objects influence each other in layered or chained reactions.

The result is a faster, more intuitive approach to motion design that emphasizes realism and creative control.
